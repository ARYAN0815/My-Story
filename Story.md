One day the monkey met an alligator who was very sad and hugry so the monkey jumped from it tree to another to give some juicy fruits to the aligator. And then everyday from that day the monkey used to give food to the alligator and the alligator used to take the monkey on its back in the water for a fun ride. The monkey and the alligator became best freinds. One day the alligator camme and said hi monkey i want to take you to my home and itroduce you to my wife.The monkey said okay i am coming down. The monkey got back on the alligators back and said lets go to your house. After 5 minutes of the journey the alligator said i tricked you we are acctaully going to my houes so that me and my wife can feast on you. Then the monkey said oh really! i forgot my heart my heart in my tree so can we go get it back please. The alligator said okay and he took the monkey back to his house then the monkey climbed back on it tree and said i already have my heart inside of me but i just fooled saying i left my heart at my house. And then the monkey broke into a huge laugh. The alligator felt foolish and angry and scared at the same time as he was thinking what his wife would do if she found out that the monkey escaped so easily.
